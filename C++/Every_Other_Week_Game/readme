If you would like to play the game, you can download the contents of this folder and then click on the Game.exe shortcut. If that doesn't
work, try navigating to Game_Project/cmake-build-debug and run the file Game.exe directly. Note that the executable is compiled to run on
Windows machines.

Additionally, if you would like the audio to work, it is necessary that you have the OpenAL API installed. It can be found here: https://www.openal.org/
