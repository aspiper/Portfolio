If you would like to play the game, you can download the contents of this folder, navigate to Game_Project/cmake-build-debug, then run Game.exe. 
Note that the executable is compiled to run on Windows machines.

Additionally, if you would like the audio to work, it is necessary that you have the OpenAL API installed. It can be found here: https://www.openal.org/
